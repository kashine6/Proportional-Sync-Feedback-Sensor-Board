# PFS (Proportional Feedback Sensor) for MMU

This is a Proportional Feedback Sensor solution designed for MMU systems.

## 🧩 What Is a Proportional Feedback Sensor?

A *Proportional Feedback Sensor* is a more advanced type of feedback sensor solution.
Compared to other feedback solutions, it:

- **Outputs a signal ranging from 1.0 (maximum compression) to -1.0 (maximum tension)**
- **0.0 represents the neutral position**

With this signal, the firmware can determine the exact current position of the feedback slider and adjust it toward neutral at any moment.

It can also function as a simplified **clog and tangle detection mechanism without using an encoder**.

## 🛠 Hardware Design

This design does **not** use a dedicated standalone mainboard.
Instead, it leverages the **ADC input** already available on existing MMU boards.


- **You must connect the signal output to a pin that supports ADC input.**

- **Power input must be 3.3V only.**  **Do NOT use 5V — this may damage your controller board.**

A list of recommended ADC-capable pins for common MMU boards will be provided below.

## ⚠ ADC Pull-up Considerations

Some boards—such as **MMB, EBB36, or EBB42**—have **built-in pull-up resistors** on all available ADC inputs.

To support both boards with and without pull-up resistors,  this sensor board uses a special design compatible with both cases.



Using a MMU board with ADC pull-ups will cause the sensor's ADC reading to shift upward by approximately **+0.1V** (depending on pull-up resistance).

You can compensate for this in firmware configuration.



If your MMU board's ADC pin **does not** include a pull-up resistor and you want a perfectly accurate voltage reading:
 You may **move the 0-ohm resistor** on the PSF board to an alternate position to eliminate any offset.
